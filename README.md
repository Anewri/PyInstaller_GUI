# PyInstaller_GUI
This repository contains the python 3 pyinstaller script brought to all of us in a graphical way to make it a little easier for us when creating executable programs.

This is an initiative to transport those vital tools that we use when programming in python, thus we save time since instead of writing the only thing we will have to do is give a couple of clicks.

You are free to add or modify what you like, let's perfect this graphic tool together.
